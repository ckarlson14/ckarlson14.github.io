I tricked you.



Still trying to figure this thing out.



It's amazing that almost anything you want to do with a computer is free if you're willing to learn how to do it. I guess that's why all these companies exist...pay money or time. Shoot. Catch-22. If you think you're fast enough at learning that by spending relatively small amount of time you would come out on top that also means that you're smart enough that your time should be worth even more. That also probably means you've done it before and overestimate your ability to hack because in the end you figured it out...but every system is designed by different minds and it will take much longer than you think. Regardless, you never know what skills you'll end up combining to make something new if you just keep learning. Throw shit at the wall til it sticks.
