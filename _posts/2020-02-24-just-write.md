After a few ~~days~~ ~~years~~ lifetime of thinking, I've decided to just start writing. I'm not sure exactly about what, but maybe I'll start with why.



A few thoughts jump to mind immediately. For one, writing helps clarify thinking. It's an amazing feeling when you read a sentence or an idea and think 'wow, I've had that exact thought but have never been able to piece it together'. That's why standup comedy works, and why and reading your favorite authors or twitter personalities online can be so engaging. They know how to connect directly with your unconscious. I'm not saying that's going to happen, but if you throw enough pucks at the net, one may sneak through.



Secondly, and selfishly, writing helps you (me) move on. Say you have a great idea, and keep marinating it, trying to perfect it in your mind. It's extremely difficult to put that idea to bed and start on something new, especially until you've worked it out. Writing out thoughts I have will hopefully let me blow off some mental steam and move on to other engaging topics. I figure once you stop using mental resources to try and remember, you can rather use them to create. Akin to how taking a photo of the sunset can diminish our memory of it, because our brains no longer believe they need to prioritize the actual view--but in reverse. 



I see a lot of articles online citing research or ideas--obviously that is ideal. However, at this point I and we all have consumed so much information, there really isn't an exact way to pinpoint where it came from. There may indeed be no source of novel ideas. This connundrum reminds me of one of my favorite and only quotes I've saved (ironically), but Ralph Waldo Emerson, who put it best: "I cannot remember the books I have read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me". 



I give myself the benefit of the doubt, sort of like my essay writing or coding strategy (for efficiency purposes only). Better to make sure what you're doing the first time is the best way, cause it sure saves time going back at it again. I find it incredibly difficult to look back at my old code or old writing, perhaps this is because I'm a hack (not in a good way), or perhaps its because there's some odd sense of connection with past times. Finality. What da Vinci wrote every day in his notebooks has held on for 500 years, preserved exactly how it flowed from his mind. What a shame it would be if in his old age he got ashamed of these thoughts and went back and changed, or god forbid *erased* them from existence. But I digress and am making excuses for not only my bad writing and my bad coding, but also for my quite possibly wrong ideas about the world, that my present self at the time deemed adequate to resign to memory.
